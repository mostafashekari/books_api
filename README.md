Here’s a complete `README.md` for your **Gorilla Mux Books API** project:

## **Features**
- **Add a Book**: Add new books to the collection.
- **Get All Books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **Get a Book by ID**: Fetch the details of a specific book by its ID.
- **Delete a Book**: Remove a book from the collection.

## **How to Run**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Install **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/books_api.git
cd books_api
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
go mod tidy
```

### **4. Run the Server**
```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## **Testing the API**

### **Using cURL**
- **Get All Books**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/books
  ```

- **Get a Book by ID**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/books/1
  ```

- **Add a Book**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"3","title":"Learning Go","author":"Alice Johnson"}' http://localhost:8000/books
  ```

- **Delete a Book**:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/books/1
  ```

### **Using Postman**
1. Import the endpoints into Postman.
2. Test the API using the endpoints listed above.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Integrate with a database for persistent data storage (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
- Add input validation for better error handling.
- Implement user authentication for secure access.
